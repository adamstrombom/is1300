----------TASK1----------------------------
Study the recorded trace. Think about what we are observing with this recording, and
how it relates to the task model we discussed in the lecture.
How often does a context switch occur between tasks?

	Since they have the same prio, context switching will occur after a time quntum defined by the round robin algorithm usd by freertos
	
How long does it take to complete a task from the time it starts? With what period do
the tasks run?

	Blink1: Finished after max: 4.5ms		min: 2.5ms	period: 11-14ms
	Blink2: Finished after max:	7.5ms	min:	6.5ms	period: 26-27ms
	
After using xDelayUntil(): blink1 period 10ms, blink2 period 20ms

changing prio:
Blink1 higher than Blink2
	Blink 1 finished after 2.5ms and 2.5ms and Blink2 after 7.5ms
	
Blink1 same as Blink2
	Blink 1 finished after 4.5ms and 2.5ms and Blink2 after 7.5ms
	
	
Blink 1 lower than Blink2
	Blink 1 finished after 7.5ms and 2.5ms and Blink2 after 5ms
	

Hyperperiod is 20ms since its the lowest common denominator

Utilization: (2.5+5.0+2.5)/20 = 0.50 -> 50%

Roughly 10ms idle time

Both Blink1 and Blink2 can meet their deadlines.


After blink3 is added:
	blink3 should require roughly 3ms to execute (wait_cycles(250000))
	
	Blink1 is in risk of not being able to finish before deadline, at least as long its prio is the same or lower than blink2
	
Do all tasks Blink1(), Blink2() and UserButton() meet their deadline?
	Yes, from the diagram it appears that they make their deadlines.
